# Hypothesis and Problem Statement

## Hypothesis
### Player Position and Penalties

In NFL games, certain player positions tend to receive more penalties than others due to the nature of their roles and responsibilities on the field.

Outcome:

Explore whether certain player positions tend to receive more penalties than others. Analyzing the distribution of penalties based on player positions to identify any patterns or tendencies

## Problem Statement

In the National Football League (NFL), teams often face challenges in managing their penalties effectively during games. These penalties, ranging from infractions such as holding and pass interference to unsportsmanlike conduct, can significantly impact game outcomes. Understanding the relationship between the frequency and severity of penalties and game results is crucial for teams and coaches to develop strategies that minimize penalties and maximize their chances of success. Therefore, there is a need to investigate whether there is a correlation between the number and types of penalties incurred by NFL teams during games and their overall performance, measured in terms of win-loss records and other key metrics. This project aims to analyze NFL data to determine the impact of penalties on game outcomes and provide insights that can inform coaching strategies and decision-making processes in professional football.
