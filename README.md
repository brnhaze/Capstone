## Project Description

Apply learnings from program to leverage data exploring problems and presenting findings.

- Accessing data using APIs
- Cleaning and transforming data using Python
- Loading data into a database using Python
- Performing EDA, including using both statistics and visualizations
- Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models
- Interpreting the results of the statistical models

## Goal
- Set a well-defined problem with impact clearly identified;
- Execute the data analysis techniques learned throughout the program;
- Demonstrate insights and potential solutions via a dashboard that incorporates best practices of data visualization and is appropriate for a non-technical audience;
- Create instructions for users to interact with the dashboard.

## Outcomes
- Apply data analysis techniques to explore a problem of your choosing
- Showcase your insights through an impactful stakeholder-facing dashboard
- Add a valuable project to your portfolio to leverage during interviews
